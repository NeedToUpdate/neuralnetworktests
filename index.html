        Neural Network Tests
    </h1>
    <p class="main-description">All of these projects are made with just one library. It has no dependencies, other than self-written matrix and vector libraries. The drawing is all done by a rather simple div manipulation library, that was
        improved heavily with this future project</p>
    <div class="option-box">
        <h4 class="subheading">solving MNIST with a simple dense NN</h4>
        <p class="explanation">This uses a model with 3 dense layers with sigmoid activation functions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="option-box">
        <h4 class="subheading">solving MNIST with a CNN</h4>
        <p class="explanation">This model uses 2 convolution layers with relu and maxpools, fololwed by one dense layer. Much more effective than the nn above</p>
    </div>
    <div class="option-box">
        <h4 class="subheading">Predicting a single word with a simple RNN</h4>
        <p class="explanation">This model has a single reccurent layer, followed by a dense layer. It can learn one word basically.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="option-box">
        <h4 class="subheading">Learning a whole alphabet with a LSTM</h4>
        <p class="explanation">This model now uses a single LSTM layer to achieve learning much longer words and sentences than the model above.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="option-box">
        <h4 class="subheading">word2vec trials</h4>
        <p class="explanation">Using a simple dense layer, creates an encoder function. With 3 sentences, you can see the words grouping together with thei xy position or colour</p>
    </div>
    <div class="option-box">
        <h4 class="subheading">Eaters with crossover mutations</h4>
        <p class="explanation">The little dudes all have a simple 2 dense layer brain. Once they all die from hunger, the two best dudes have their brains mixed together, and become the parents of the next generation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="option-box">
        <h4 class="subheading">Smart Rockets</h4>
        <p class="explanation">This was a an attempt to copy <a>this project</a>, after seeing it on Coding Train. The rockets can't see the target, they only know thier own speed, x and y position, and how much fuel they have left. Once
            they all die, the fittest gets cloned and mutated.</p>
